# Double Open Policy Configuration
This repository is used to maintain the license classification (license-classifications.yml) created by Double Open. 

# Rationale
We aim to maintain the classification to be consumed by ORT (Open Review Toolkit) in automatic open source compliance reviews. However, the content of the license classification is useful in many manual instances too, at least for us.
Any one is free to use the license classification, subject to its publishing guidelines. As you can see, the license-classification is published by us freely, without any warranties. 

# ORT rules
We do not currently maintain our ORT rules as a public version. However, we have published a small ruleset to help in combining the the license classification with your ORT rules.

# Contributing to the license classification
Unclassified or unchecked licenses and new license variants - as well as some new licenses - are identified in new compliance projects. Also, there could be discussion points or errors in the current classification. 
Change proposals to the license classification can be done with pull request or with github issues. We expect new content to be published in our repository under CC0, as we publish our work under CC0. Submitting new or changed material, whether with pull requests or github issues, includes acceptance of CC0 for said material. 

# Paid services
If you need a warranty for the content of the classification, or for the timely maintenance of the classification for new modifications, please be in contact.
